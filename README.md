# jeff

Jeff converts Flash™ SWFs into a JSON/PNG format for high performance usage in HTML/JavaScript.
The extracted content could be used to integrate Flash™ Animations in your game using your favorite HTML Game Engine.

Contains a variety of options to allow you to get performance where you need it:

Optimised speed performance:

- Asset rasterisation (faster than vectorial drawing)
- Image Atlas creation (to enable batch sprite rendering in WebGL)
- Extracting images with power of 2 dimensions (to enable mipmapping)

Optimised memory performance:

- Image compression (lossy and loss-less compressions)
- Animation Scaling (to rasterise images at the exact size needed)

Optimised ease of use:

- Gathering several animations in a single output: Reduced number of assets to manage
- Frame by Frame rasterisation: for easy integration in your game

Very good scalability: from both the command line as well as through the API, it can be used to do batch extraction on multiple SWFs.

## Install

For command line usage:

```shell
npm install jeff -g
```

For API usage:

```shell
npm install jeff
```

## Usage

Command line:

```shell
jeff -s mySwf.swf
```

API:

```javascript
var jeff = require('jeff');

// Writing extracted data in current folder
var options = {
	source: 'mySwf.swf',
	outDir: '.'
};

jeff(options);


// Returning extracted data in a callback
var options = {
	source: 'mySwf.swf',
	returnData: true
};

jeff(options, function (error, stats, extractedData) {
	// Uncovering conversion stats
	var nbFilesConverted = stats.files;
	var nbErrors         = stats.errors;

	// Fetching extracted data
	var imageNames = extractedData.imageNames;
	var image      = extractedData.images;
	var data       = extractedData.data;
});
```

### Operation

* Will parse the input directory to find SWF files corresponding to the given source file pattern.
* Will sequentially parse and process the SWF files.
* Will export JSON meta-data and images corresponding to the SWF files.

For a list of command line options:

```shell
jeff -h
```

### Roadmap for unsupported features

* Texts (Static/Dynamic)
* Buttons
* Embedded fonts
* Sounds
* ActionScript

## Roadmap for extract options

* Option to extract shapes under vectorial format
* Option to extract meta-data under keyframe based format (as opposed to per frame transformation matrix)
